The 28 pins will allow for potetntial additions as the project's inclusions are adjusted and it meets my sub-system's specific need for I2C (for a screen interface).</p> <p>Display Screens</p> <ol> <li>NHD-C0220BIZ-FS(RGB)-FBW-3VM</li> </ol> <p></p> <ul> <li>$14.46/each</li> <li>link</li> </ul> Pros Cons Specifically designed for I2C Fairly expensive, especially if multiple needed Good Datasheet with accessible key commands Shipping could be a problem, espeically with added tariff RGB backgrounds to make text appear more clearly <ol> <li>AMC0802BR-B-Y6WFDY-I2C</li> </ol> <p></p> <ul> <li>$8.49/each</li> <li>link</li> </ul> Pros Cons Specifically designed for I2C Much less display space compared to other options Cost effective Might require separate voltage regulation from other parts (higher voltage) Physically smaller (less space on board) <ol> <li>NHD-0216AW-IB3</li> </ol> <p></p> <ul> <li>$28.49/each</li> <li>link</li> </ul> Pros Cons Specifically designed for I2C Very expensive, can likely one order one Wide voltage range No Backlight is included More visually pleasing OLED Screen, rather than a more simplistic LCD <p>Choice: Option 1: NHD-C0220BIZ-FS(RGB)-FBW-3VM</p> <p>Rationale: The NHD-C0220BIZ-FS(RGB)-FBW-3VM was selected due to it being a good balance of cost and effectiveness, as it has fairly solid display capapbilities and should be able to show important data while also being able to be smoothly integrated with the rest of the system (voltage, spacing, I2C, etc.).</p> <p>Push-Buttons</p> <ol> <li>3491 (Adafruit Pushbutton)</li> </ol> <p></p> <ul> <li>$ 2.50 / each</li> <li>link</li> </ul> Pros Cons Includes a built-in LED, making it easier to identify the button's state Rather expensive cost per button Larger button for easier pressing The LED light is dimmer when run at 3.3 V Works with a decent range of voltages, so no specific regulation is required <ol> <li>PRT-14460 (Spark-fun Electronics)</li> </ol> <p></p> <ul> <li>$ 1.75 / pack, $ 0.44/button</li> <li>link</li> </ul> Pros Cons Very inexpensive Datasheet with very minimal information Each button is a different color to distingush between functions Buttons might be a bit small and difficult for accurate pressing 4 are in each pack, so there's potentially one spare <ol> <li>1010 (Adafruit square button pack)</li> </ol> <p></p> <ul> <li>$ 5.95 / pack, $ 0.40 / button</li> <li>link</li> </ul> Pros Cons Square buttons that are easy to press, so a young student can easily press/use them Datasheet with very little useful information Multiple colors and many spares Only comes in a large pack, so more buttons than needed and higher cost, despite low cost per button <p>Choice: Option 2: PRT-14460 (Spark-fun Electronics)</p> <p>Rationale: These buttons are the best choice for the purposes of this project due to their low cost, as this component is not particularly important to the workings of the project, with others needing to take higher priority, though colored buttons would help its overall cohesion and presentation.</p> <p>Voltage Regulators </p> <ol> <li>LM2575-3.3WU</li> </ol> <p></p> <ul> <li>$1.75 / each</li> <li>link</li> </ul> Pros Cons Meets project requirements with fairly easy implementation Might have issues if higher current applications are needed Can work with a large variety of input voltages Slightly less efficient than some other options Prior experience in working with variants of it <ol> <li>LM2674M-3.3</li> </ol> <p></p> <ul> <li>$ 3.97 / each</li> <li>link</li> </ul> Pros Cons High efficiency Relatively high per unit cost Designed to function with minimal outside componentss Very low maximum current ratings compared to other options <ol> <li>LMR51430YFDDCR</li> </ol> <p></p> <ul> <li>$ 1.29 / each</li> <li>link</li> </ul> Pros Cons Cost Effective while also providing good specs (max current, etc) Adjustable, thus it may not be optimized for the specific 3.3 V that will be needed for the circuit (less efficient, etc) Small size, won\u2019t take up much space on a PCB Inconsistencies in accuracy could be problematic for more sensitive components <p>Choice:  Option 1 - LM2575-3.3WU</p> <p>Explanation: Due to familiarity with this type of  voltage regulator and it meeting the needs for the user interface system, it has been selected as this system\u2019s voltage regulator. The other chosen components should work with this voltage regulator in regards to power requirements and this in combination with it seeming more suitable than the other reviewed options make it the best choice of these three options.</p>"},{"location":"Individual_Component_Selection/#part-2-microcontroller-pic-selection","title":"Part 2 Microcontroller (PIC) Selection:","text":"PIC Info Answer Help Model PIC18F27Q10 Include the entire part number (leave off any letters at the end that specify the package type) Product Page URL link Do not paste links directly into the table.

The two other GPIOs which are configured to output are for the LCD's clear function and a testing LED. Additonally UART pins are present to account for communication between devices in the project.

As shown in the power budget table above, a 3.3V rail powers the three main components of the microcontroller, LCD, and buttons and the applied current is within acceptable thresholds (the current for the buttons accounts for the 10k ohm pullup resistors that will be used with them).
