## Power Budget Description:
------------------------------
In choosing the components for the User Interface system, it was important to keep track of how the components would synchronize in terms of power consumption, etc. So this power budget allowed for the current and voltage requirements to be displayed. As shown in the power budget table above, a 3.3V rail powers the three main components of the microcontroller, LCD, and buttons and the applied current is within acceptable thresholds (the current for the buttons accounts for the 10k ohm pullup resistors that will be used with them). Knowing these values will also help in cooridinating power consumption and needs with the rest of the team's systems to make sure that the power supply for the project is adequate.
