## Updated Power Budget Explanation:
------------------------------
In choosing the components for the User Interface system, it was important to keep track of how the components would synchronize in terms of power consumption, etc. So this power budget allowed for the current and voltage requirements to be displayed. As shown in the power budget table above, a 3.3V rail powers the three main components of the microcontroller, OLED, and buttons and the applied current is within acceptable thresholds (the current for the buttons accounts for the 10k ohm pullup resistors that will be used with them). Knowing these values will also help in cooridinating power consumption and needs with the rest of the team's systems to make sure that the power supply for the project is adequate. The main change from the original power budget was the inclusion of the new OLED, which was found to have negligible impact on the current requriements, so this system will work with the regulator I selected (within the 1000mA range of it) and the 2A power source.
