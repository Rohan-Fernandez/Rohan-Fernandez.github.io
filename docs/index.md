Introduction:

Hello, my name is Rohan Fernandez and I am doing the HMI sub-section of team 311's adaptive solar panel project. The HMI system will mainly be including a display that will show the readings from a set of two and the current mode of the device, being either manual or automatic. Additionally there will be two buttons for manual control of the solar panel's position, if manual mode is enabled, so that students can compare their experience manually adjusting it to match incoming light versus automating the process with an external sensor.
