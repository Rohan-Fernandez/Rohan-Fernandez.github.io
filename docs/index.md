Introduction:

Hello, my name is Rohan Fernandez and I am doing the User Interface sub-section of team 311's adaptive solar panel project. The U-I system will mainly be including a display that will show the readings from the voltage sensors and the position of the motors. Additionally there will be a set of 4 buttons for manual control of the solar panel's position, so that students can compare their experience manually adjusting it to match incoming light versus automating the process with an external sensor.
