    * $0.50/each
    * [link](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/PIC16F15213T-I-MF/12807572)

    | Pros                                      | Cons                                                             |
    | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Supports UART and I2C                     | Will be difficult to solder due to size and type            |
    | Very small and cost effective             | Not flexible for project changes or errors                  |
    | Meets surface mount requirements |

2. PIC18F27Q10-I/SO

    * $1.45/each
    * [link](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/PIC18F27Q10-I-SO/10064343)

    | Pros                                      | Cons                                                             |
    | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Supports UART and I2C                     | Will need its specs to be closely monitored in the datasheet (specific voltages, etc.) |
    | Good memory and general specs             | Chip's length might create spacing concerns                                         |
    | Surface mount version to meet project requriements, more space-economical than 40 pin version |

3. PIC18F14Q20-I/SS

    * $0.92/each
    * [link](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/PIC18F14Q20-I-SS/24617052)

    | Pros                                      | Cons                                                             |
    | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Supports UART and I2C, also similar to what was used in class| Small amount of memory, can pose serious issues, especially with the already fairly slow I2C |
    | Very cost-effective                       | Comparitively lower capabilities                     |
    | Meets surface mount constraint of project | Described as a new component, may be buggier than more tested/older ones


**Choice:** Option 2: PIC18F27Q10-I/SO

**Rationale:** The PIC18F27Q10 was selected due to it being cost-effective while also providing solid capabilities compared to the other options. The 28 pins will allow for potetntial additions as the project's inclusions are adjusted and it meets my sub-system's specific need for I2C (for a screen interface).

    | Pros                                      | Cons                                                             |
    | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Specifically designed for I2C             | Fairly expensive, especially if multiple needed              |
    | Good Datasheet with accessible key commands  | Shipping could be a problem, espeically with added tariff |
    | RGB backgrounds to make text appear more clearly | 

2. AMC0802BR-B-Y6WFDY-I2C

    | Pros                                      | Cons                                                             |
    | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Specifically designed for I2C             | Much less display space compared to other options            |
    | Cost effective                            | Might require separate voltage regulation from other parts (higher voltage) |
    | Physically smaller (less space on board) | 

3. NHD-0216AW-IB3

    * $28.49/each
    * [link](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/newhaven-display-intl/NHD-0216AW-IB3/6198749)
    
    | Pros                                      | Cons                                                             |
    | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Specifically designed for I2C             | Very expensive, can likely one order one            |
    | Wide voltage range                        | No Backlight is included |
    | More visually pleasing OLED Screen, rather than a more simplistic LCD |

**Choice:** Option 1: NHD-C0220BIZ-FS(RGB)-FBW-3VM

**Rationale:** The NHD-C0220BIZ-FS(RGB)-FBW-3VM was selected due to it being a good balance of cost and effectiveness, as it has fairly solid display capapbilities and should be able to show important data while also being able to be smoothly integrated with the rest of the system (voltage, spacing, I2C, etc.).
